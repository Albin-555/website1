                    The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra.
                    It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

                        Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I.

                        The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan.
                         Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546.

                        Hampi is one of the most beautiful historical sites in the history of India. It was the first capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, situated on the bank of River Tungabhadra.
                         The hills – Matanga, Malyavanta and Anjaneya Hills, wrap this historical site on three sides, and on the other side flows the Tungabhadra River.

                        The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the tallest building in the world that has been built without a foundation.
                         It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree angle, and a pyramidal shape which has helped it stay erect for centuries. The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna.

                        The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument of Indian Architecture.
                        It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha.

                         An iron pillar in the courtyard gave the mosque a unique Indian aesthetic.
